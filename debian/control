Description: Real time MIDI sequencer
 Seq24 was created to provide a very simple interface for editing and 
 playing midi 'loops'. It is a very minimal sequencer that excludes the 
 bloated features of the large software sequencers and includes a small 
 subset that proved to be useful for live performances.
